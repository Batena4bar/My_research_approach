Abnormal returns requires an abnormal approach


With an emphasis on contrarian thinking, it is suggested that abnormal returns stem from ideas with ‘edge’. I argue that this motive represents something markedly differnet to that of tradaitional scientific pursuit and thus, requires some adjustments to be made to the process. However, this does not mean that the process should be any less rigorous.

The main difference, I believe, is how the hypothesis should be approached within the study of markets. In traditional scientific pursuit, hypotheses logically follow an extensive literature review and creating a sense that the hypotheses are yet another block on top of the theoretical pyramid. When attempting to build market beating strategies, however, often the best hypotheses are not generated by building on top of already established literature and techniques, but instead from independent insights from experience and observation that are far removed from those that came before. In this case, it makes sense for hypotheses to logically preced a literature review. This would then allow the review of the current literature to provide competition to the new ideas and the perfect place for scientific scrutiny.

When creating new market INDICIES, a more traditional approach to resarch is adopted:

1. Introduction of concept
2. Literature review
3. Construction of index
4. Index performance hypothesis
5. Methods of analysis
6. Analysis
7. Discussion

When creating new MODELS and TRADING STRATEGIES, a less traditional approach to resarch is required:

1. Method Proposal (Preliminary hypothesis)
2. Literature review
3. Refined hypothesis
4. Methods (including optimisation process & varied market conditions)
5. Back Testing & Optimisation
6. Comparison to established models
7. Discussion
